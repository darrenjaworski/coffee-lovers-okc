Inspired by page 50 of [edible OKC](http://www.edibleokc.com/)'s January and February issue, this project is designed to create a community of coffee enthusiasts in OKC.

Basic app to:
- inventory
- map
- rate
- provide information -- on OKC coffee venues
- create a place for local coffee people to come together and love on our favorite thing, coffee

Ideas are more than welcomed.
