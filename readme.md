# summon okc coffee lovers

Inspired by page 50 of [edible OKC](http://www.edibleokc.com/)'s January and February issue, this project is designed to create a community of coffee enthusiasts in OKC.

Basic app to:
- inventory
- map
- rate
- provide information -- on OKC coffee venues
- create a place for local coffee people to come together and love on our favorite thing, coffee

Ideas are more than welcomed.

- (in addition to roaster vs. espresso vs. cold brew vs. pour over vs. the-next-hipster-coffee-trend-where-it-drips-for-two-weeks-before-you-can-drink-it, etc.): hours, drive-thru, ease of parking, wifi/cool atmosphere, food served, vegetarian/vegan-friendly, events (open mic night, music, group gatherings, clubs, etc.), keep it local/citycard/other discount/loyalty program participants
